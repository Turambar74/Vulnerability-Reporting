# Vulnerability-Reporting
Downloads the latest vulnerability list from the NVD, determines which of those impact the current system, and reports them along with a brief description of the nature of the vulnerabilities.

Run the detevtVuln.py script. The nvd data feeds are stored in the 'nvd' directory. The directory should be created the first time the script is run, if it doesn't already exist.

The vulnerabilities are stored in JSON format. As a result this application scales very poorly due to high memory overhead. Will look into solving this issue in the future.
